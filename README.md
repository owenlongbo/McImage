```groovy
McImageConfig {
    isCheckSize true //Whether to detect image size，default true
    optimizeType "Compress" //Optimize Type，"ConvertWebp" or "Compress"，default "Compress", "CompressWebp" is a better compression ratio but it don't support api < 18
    maxSize 1*1024*1024 //big image size threshold，default 1MB
    enableWhenDebug false //switch in debug build，default true
    isCheckPixels true // Whether to detect image pixels of width and height，default true
    maxWidth 1000 //default 1000
    maxHeight 1000 //default 1000
    whiteList = [ //do not do any optimization for the images who in the list 
              "icon_launcher.png"
    ]
    mctoolsDir "$rootDir"
